# Popmotion

Integerating a JavaScript library from Popmotion into a webpage. The library produces an animation 'spring', that allows the ball* to 
be dragged by a mouse click and on release, the ball will spring back into the original positon using realistic physics.

*in this case it's essentially a div named class 'box' which is rounded into a ball shape using CSS.
